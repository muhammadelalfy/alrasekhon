## About Rasekhon

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## create repository files 
```php artisan make:repository {Model}```


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  git clone 
  git checkout develop
  
  ## create local develop branch for local development and don not publish

  ## use laravel homestead for better local development
  cp .env - .env.example

  composer install

  php artisan migrate

  php artisan db:seed 
  
  npm install
  ##for local deployment & dev
  npm run dev 
  ##for build deployment
  npm run build 


```

Let's get started.....

A typical git commit message will look like
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
 
build: Build related changes (eg: npm related/ adding external dependencies)
chore: A code change that external user wont see (eg: change to .gitignore file or .prettierrc file)
feat: A new feature
fix: A bug fix
docs: Documentation related changes
refactor: A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature. (eg: You can use this when there is semantic changes like renaming a variable/ function name)
perf: A code that improves performance
style: A code that is related to styling
test: Adding new test or making changes to existing test
```

    navigate to project route & here you Go ;)
